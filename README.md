# MinMax
Maximizing your calories for any budget size. 
This project is pretty simple, being one of my first forays into Java. 
It uses the knapsack algorithm to choose items that maximize your caloric intake for a budget you set.
Right now, your options are Taco Bell, Chick-fil-A, or McDonalds, but this could be expanded to anything if you had the proper dataset.
Additionally, the program currently values calories, but this could be shifted to metrics like protein or weight if the data was there.
I apologize for the mess of code that is the main file. 
Thanks for reading!
